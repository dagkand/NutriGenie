      <h3>Determining Your Ideal Macro Split</h3>
    <p>Your macro split, or the distribution of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in your diet, plays a crucial role in achieving your health and fitness goals. Here's a brief guide to determining the correct macro split based on your objectives:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Weight Loss:</strong> If your goal is to lose weight, you may benefit from a higher protein intake to support muscle retention while reducing overall calorie consumption. A common recommendation is to aim for a moderate carbohydrate intake, focusing on complex carbohydrates to support sustained energy levels, and a moderate to low fat intake. A good and normal calorie goal to set when reducing body weight is 500 calories less than what is needed.</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> For weight maintenance, aim for a balanced macro split that aligns with your energy needs. This typically involves consuming a moderate amount of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to sustain your current weight and energy levels. When maintaining your bodyweight it is very simple, just have the calorie goal as what is recommended to you.</li>
      <li><strong>Bulking:</strong> If your goal is to gain muscle mass, you'll likely need to increase your overall calorie intake, with a particular focus on carbohydrates and proteins. A higher carbohydrate intake can fuel intense workouts and support muscle growth, while sufficient protein intake is essential for muscle repair and growth. Fat intake should still be moderate to support overall health. When bulking you may want to increase your calorie amount by about 500 calories each day.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It's important to note that individual needs may vary, and experimentation may be necessary to find the optimal macro split that works best for you. Consulting with a registered dietitian or nutritionist can provide personalized guidance based on your unique goals and preferences.</p>
